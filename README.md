# Heterogeneous style transfer

## Introduction

This repository contains the experiments for heterogeneous style transfer based on a pyCaffe-based implementation of "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by L. Gatys etal, from repo https://github.com/fzliu/style-transfer, and a pytorch simplified version of heterogeneous style transfer based on the offical pytorch style transfer.

Caffe version using L-BFGS is used for minimization.

## Requirements

 - Python >= 2.7
 - CUDA >= 6.5 (highly recommended)
 - Caffe

CUDA will enable GPU-based computation in Caffe.
